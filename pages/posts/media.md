title: 'Dev contents in 2024 make no sense'

While I appreciate the content that has helped me grow in the past, I’ve noticed a worrying trend in 2024 that seems to undermine its value. I've always been a big fan of getting new knowledge by watching YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook posts about software development. However, there’s an ongoing trend that I'm not so happy to see: more and more software development content is using fear-mongering tactics to trick us into clicking, preying on our FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).

Many YouTube channels aimed at beginner software developers seem more focused on the profits than on providing real value. I’m not saying this out of bias—these were once my go-to sources for learning. But as time has passed, I feel like the quality has hit rock bottom.

A common pattern in video titles includes phrases like "Don't use Try Catch" or "What you're doing is totally wrong." When you click to watch, the content often reiterates things you already know, followed by a dramatic claim that you're doing something wrong. Then, the video quickly pivots to promoting sponsored products, online courses, or services they're trying to sell.

The knowledge gained from these videos has steadily decreased, to the point where I consider them mostly clickbait. Maybe these videos are aimed at beginners, and I’m past that stage now.

What I think is happening is that some creators focus more on exploiting insecurities than providing valuable insight. They capture our attention, then steer us toward their products, courses, and services that promise to fix our "flaws." This is marketing 101. The substance doesn't match the hype, leaving people feeling less confident and like they're falling short—even though the original concern may not have been that significant. These creators make you feel lesser, implying that you always need their opinions, just to get you to stick around and watch their promotional content, all while gaining a constant flow of revenue.

It’s exhausting to go into a video expecting improvement, only to leave feeling manipulated or sold to. This type of content capitalizes on emotions, making people feel like they need to constantly consume to improve, which can be overwhelming and counterproductive. I hope creators start focusing on delivering real, practical value rather than sensationalizing issues to sell products. In the end, we should strive to build each other up, not profit from each other's insecurities.
