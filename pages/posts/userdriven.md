title: 'The Cost of a "User-Driven" System with No Filters'
date: 2025-05-17

**Database** without Primary Key, Foreign Key, Constraint  
→ **Spreadsheet + GUID cosplay**

**Project Owner** without System Ownership, Product Vision/Direction, Accountability  
→ **A feature wishlist printer who doesn’t know how the app works**

**Business Engineer** without Decision Confidence, Technical Understanding, Flow Awareness, Prioritization  
→ **A fear-driven feedback generator**

**Dev**  
→ **Left customizing code and architecture based on reactive emotional fear**

That was the moment I realized: this isn’t product development — this is chaos management.

---

## Here’s what that really means:
- No product ownership  
- No logic gate between wishful thinking and production  
- No pushback, no filtering, no prioritization  
- Just BA/BE acting as **human forward bots**, dumping raw input on devs

---

## What happens next:
- The system bends to every fear, every whim, every “what if”  
- Business logic turns into duct tape  
- Flow becomes an emotional rollercoaster  
- And engineers?  
  → We become the **sanity firewall** — rewriting backend code to accommodate feelings, not facts

---

## Reality check:
- **User-driven ≠ user-ruled.**  
  Building software is not the same as saying yes to everything.
- If no one protects the system, it will rot — no matter how many devs you hire.
