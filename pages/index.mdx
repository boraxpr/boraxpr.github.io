## ðŸ§  No magics, only abstractions and implementations.

- Software engineer (MUICT 2021), TOEIC 940/990  
- Backend-focused, system-aware, anti-bloat  
- Fluent in Java, Node.js, Go, Rust, Python, SQL â€” I use what works when itâ€™s needed  
- Frameworks are tools â€” when you understand how the system fits, you donâ€™t depend on magic. From frontend to backend, infra to data, I know how and when to apply modular architecture that lasts  
- **Platform Engineering** â€” Engineered and automated internal systems for CI/CD, workflow orchestration, container platforms, and observability â€” on-prem and in the cloud  
- Linux power user (Fedora / Ubuntu / Arch) 
- I donâ€™t ship junk and run â€” I own what I build
