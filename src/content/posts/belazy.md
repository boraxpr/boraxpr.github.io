title: 'Being Lazy is the First Step Toward Creating a Maintainable Solution'

Many developers fall into the trap of over-engineering solutions early on, thinking that complexity or a comprehensive feature set equates to a robust system. But in reality, simplicity is king.

When approaching a problem, the first step toward maintainability is being "lazy" This doesn't mean avoiding work—it's about being strategic with your effort. By minimizing unnecessary code, dependencies, and convoluted architecture, you can focus on what's important. Leverage default behaviors, use out-of-the-box solutions where possible, and avoid reinventing the wheel unless you have no other choice.

More code always comes at a cost. More dependencies always come at a cost. This cost is often hidden, and only a few truly notice it at first. A bloated codebase makes every future feature slower to develop, and maintenance becomes a burden. It’s easy to get caught up in adding feature after feature, but with each addition, you risk entangling the system in complexity that will slow down progress in the long run.

More custom, non-default settings mean more things to fix when dependencies upgrade or deprecate. Each customization adds layers of complexity, and when third-party libraries or tools evolve, maintaining these customizations can become a nightmare.

The beauty of a maintainable solution is that it's straightforward, predictable, and easy for others to pick up. If your codebase requires endless explanations or a detailed manual just to onboard someone new, it’s probably too complicated.

Remember: good code is not about showing off complexity; it's about clarity, efficiency, and ease of maintenance. Keep it lazy, keep it simple, and future you (and your colleagues) will thank you for it!
